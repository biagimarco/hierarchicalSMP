# Steady state analysis of hierarchical semi-Markov processes with parallel regions
This is the implementation used for experimentations in the paper "Extending the steady state analysis of hierarchical semi-Markov processes with parallel regions", published in the [15th European Performance Engineering Workshop](http://epew2018.lacl.fr/).

The experiments executable files are all contained in the "src/test/java/it/unifi/hierarchical/analysis/" folder.
